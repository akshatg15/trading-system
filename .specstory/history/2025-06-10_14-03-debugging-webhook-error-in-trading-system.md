# Debugging webhook error in trading system (2025-06-10 19:33:49)

_**User**_

Enter Architecture Mode.

We've developed a simple automated trading system for personal use.

We're currently improving it.
Currently getting this error that we're throwing:

Error processing webhook: failed to parse webhook: TP2 (3338.95000) must be greater than TP1 (3339.28000)

But wouldn't TP2 be lower than TP1 in case of a sell signal?

Also, we have 
	if signalType != "buy" && signalType != "sell" && signalType != "close" {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("invalid action: %s, must be buy/sell/close", webhook.Action)
	}

the webhook currently only sends buy/sell action.. are we relying on webhook sending close or just have it in case?
what about entry?

Entering **Architecture Mode**...

Let me analyze the existing trading system architecture and the issues you've raised. I can see this is a sophisticated automated trading system with MT5 integration, signal processing, and risk management capabilities.

## Architecture Analysis

Looking at your signal processing architecture, I can see several design decisions that need clarification and potential improvement:

**Current Architecture Overview:**
- Signal ingestion via webhooks (primarily TradingView)
- Signal processing with validation and risk checks  
- Trade execution via MT5 bridge
- Position monitoring and synchronization
- Separate handling for entry, TP1, TP2 trades

**Core Issues Identified:**

1. **TP1/TP2 Validation Logic Flaw**: Your validation assumes TP2 > TP1 universally, but for sell positions, TP levels should decrease (TP2 < TP1 for sells)

2. **Signal Type Ambiguity**: You have buy/sell/close validation but also handle "entry" in webhook parsing, creating potential confusion

3. **Webhook Field Prioritization**: Using both `Entry` and `Price` fields with fallback logic that may not align with all signal providers

## Tradeoff Analysis

**Option 1: Direction-Aware TP Validation**
We could implement direction-specific validation where buy signals require TP2 > TP1 and sell signals require TP2 < TP1. This provides accurate validation but adds complexity to the validation logic and requires careful handling of different signal types. The benefit is preventing invalid trade configurations, but it increases the complexity of webhook parsing and may require different validation rules for different brokers or instruments.

**Option 2: Flexible TP Ordering System**
We could redesign the system to use ordered TP levels (TP_NEAR, TP_FAR) rather than TP1/TP2, automatically sorting them based on trade direction. This eliminates validation confusion and makes the system more intuitive, but requires significant refactoring of existing database schema and trade creation logic. It also provides better scalability for multiple TP levels but may break existing webhook integrations.

**Option 3: Signal Type Consolidation**
We could unify the signal types to use consistent terminology (entry/exit instead of buy/sell/close) or clearly separate market actions (buy/sell) from trade management actions (close/modify). This provides clearer semantics but may require updating all webhook providers and could introduce breaking changes to existing integrations.

**Option 4: Webhook Source-Specific Parsing**
We could implement different parsing strategies for different webhook sources, allowing each provider to use their preferred terminology and validation rules. This maximizes compatibility but increases maintenance overhead and could lead to inconsistent behavior across signal sources.

**Option 5: Minimal Change Approach**
We could simply fix the TP validation logic for direction-specific cases while maintaining backward compatibility. This minimizes disruption but doesn't address the broader architectural inconsistencies and may lead to future confusion as the system scales.

Based on my analysis, I need to understand your specific requirements and constraints better before proposing the optimal architecture.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Signal Source Strategy**: Are you planning to support multiple signal providers beyond TradingView, or is this primarily a TradingView-focused system? This affects whether we need flexible webhook parsing.

2. **Trade Management Approach**: Do you envision manually sending "close" signals via webhooks, or do you prefer the system to handle closures automatically based on TP/SL hits? This determines how critical the "close" signal type is.

3. **TP Level Scaling**: Are you planning to support more than 2 take profit levels in the future (TP3, TP4, etc.), or is the 2-level system sufficient for your trading strategy?

4. **Backward Compatibility Requirements**: How important is maintaining compatibility with existing webhook configurations? Can we make breaking changes if they improve the architecture?

5. **Risk Management Evolution**: Are you planning to add more sophisticated risk management features (correlation analysis, portfolio-level limits, etc.) that might affect how signals are validated and processed?

6. **Position Management Complexity**: Do you need support for partial closes, position scaling, or trailing stops that might require different signal types beyond the current buy/sell/close model?

Please provide your thoughts on these questions so I can design the most appropriate architecture for your trading system's current and future needs.

1. For now, just tradingview
2. automatically. Or i may close manually via exness/tradingview
3. Yes, but not a current need.
4. Not really. As this is just deployed for testing right now.
5. Yes, but later on.
6. I don't think so. Not for now. Atleast!

What i mean originally, was that the webhook only sends buys/sells but we're also handling close? are we relying on a close signal to close the trade? in that case, do we also need an entry signal?

Which tradeoff approach do you think is the best?

I think 3 is the best?

Excellent questions! Let me address your specific concerns and then propose the optimal architecture.

## Current Signal Type Analysis

You're absolutely right to question the "close" signal handling. Looking at the code:

1. **Close Signal Purpose**: The "close" signal is there as a **manual override mechanism**. While your system automatically closes positions via TP/SL hits, the close signal allows you to:
   - Force-close all positions for a symbol via webhook
   - Implement emergency stops from TradingView alerts
   - Handle strategy exit signals that aren't just TP/SL based

2. **Entry vs Buy/Sell**: Currently, "buy" and "sell" ARE your entry signals. The "Entry" field in webhook parsing is just the price field name, not a signal type. This is actually creating confusion.

## Optimal Architecture: Enhanced Option 3

Based on your answers, I recommend **Option 3 (Signal Type Consolidation)** with these specific improvements:

**Proposed Signal Type System:**
- `"buy"` / `"sell"` - Entry signals (keep current)
- `"close"` - Emergency close all positions for symbol (keep current) 
- `"close_partial"` - Future: partial position closure
- Remove the Entry/Price field confusion

**Key Changes:**
1. **Fix TP1/TP2 Direction-Aware Validation**
2. **Simplify Webhook Field Handling** 
3. **Add Signal Type Documentation**
4. **Prepare for Future Scaling**

```

Would you like me to implement this architecture with the TP1/TP2 validation fix and webhook parsing improvements? The changes will:

1. **Fix the immediate TP validation bug** (direction-aware TP ordering)
2. **Clean up Entry/Price field handling** 
3. **Keep close signal for manual overrides**
4. **Maintain current buy/sell entry system**
5. **Prepare foundation for future risk management features**

This approach gives you immediate fixes while building a solid foundation for your planned enhancements. Should I proceed with implementing these changes?

Seems fine. Don't overcomplicate it.

Perfect! Let me implement the essential fixes without overcomplicating it.

Let me use the search_replace tool to fix the TP validation logic:

Perfect! The core issue is fixed. Now let me clean up the Entry/Price field handling to make it clearer:

---

Great! The fixes are implemented. Here's what I changed:

## ✅ **Architecture Changes Implemented**

### 1. **Fixed TP1/TP2 Validation Logic**
- **Before**: Always required TP2 > TP1 (incorrect for sell signals)
- **After**: Direction-aware validation:
  - **Buy signals**: TP2 > TP1 (price going up)
  - **Sell signals**: TP2 < TP1 (price going down)

### 2. **Clarified Webhook Field Handling**
- Added better comment explaining Entry vs Price field priority
- Kept the existing logic but made it clearer

### 3. **Signal Type System Remains Simple**
- `buy`/`sell` - Entry signals ✅
- `close` - Manual override for emergency exits ✅
- No unnecessary complexity added

## **Result**
Your error `"TP2 (3338.95000) must be greater than TP1 (3
