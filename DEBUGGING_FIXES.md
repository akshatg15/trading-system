# üêõ Critical Trading System Fixes

## Issues Resolved

### üî¥ **Issue 1: Database Prepared Statement Errors**
**Problem**: Sporadic "pq: unnamed prepared statement does not exist" errors
**Root Cause**: PostgreSQL connection pooling with prepared statements causing stale connections

**Solution Applied:**
1. **Enhanced Database URL Configuration** (`internal/config/config.go`)
   - Added `default_query_exec_mode=simple_protocol` to disable prepared statements
   - Added connection pool stability parameters:
     - `pool_max_conn_lifetime=30m` - Force connection refresh
     - `pool_max_conn_idle_time=5m` - Reduce idle time
     - `connect_timeout=10` - Connection timeout

2. **Improved Connection Pool Settings** (`internal/database/db.go`)
   - Reduced max connections from 5 to 3 for stability
   - Set max idle connections to 1 to prevent stale connections
   - Added connection lifetime limits (15 minutes)
   - Enhanced connection testing with extended timeout and validation query

### üî¥ **Issue 2: Limit Orders Not Squaring Off Positions**
**Problem**: TP limit orders created as independent orders instead of position-closing orders
**Root Cause**: Missing position reference linking in MT5 trade execution

**Solution Applied:**
1. **Position-Based TP Order System** (`internal/signals/processor.go`)
   - Complete rewrite of `executeTPTrade()` function
   - Added parent trade validation and position existence checks
   - Implemented position-based TP order creation using MT5 position modification

2. **New MT5 Position Modification API** (`internal/mt5/client.go`)
   - Added `PositionModifyRequest` and `PositionModifyResponse` types
   - Created `ModifyPosition()` method for position-based TP management
   - Support for partial volume TP orders linked to original position

3. **Enhanced MT5 Bridge** (`mt5-bridge/src/mt5_trading_bridge/__init__.py`)
   - Added `modify_position()` method with partial TP order creation
   - Created `/position/modify` Flask endpoint
   - Implemented proper position ticket validation and partial closing logic
   - Fixed `/positions/count` endpoint URL consistency

4. **Database Trade Management** (`internal/database/db.go`)
   - Added `GetTradeByID()` method for individual trade retrieval
   - Enhanced trade relationship tracking for parent-child TP orders

## Key Improvements

### üéØ **Database Stability**
- Eliminated prepared statement conflicts
- Reduced connection pool size for better stability
- Added comprehensive connection health monitoring
- Shorter connection lifetimes prevent stale connections

### üéØ **Position Management**
- TP orders now properly reference parent positions
- Partial volume closing maintains position integrity
- Automatic position verification before TP order creation
- Proper MT5 ticket linking between entry and exit orders

### üéØ **Error Handling**
- Enhanced retry logic for database operations
- Position existence validation before TP order execution
- Comprehensive error logging for debugging
- Graceful degradation when MT5 is unavailable

## Testing Checklist

### ‚úÖ **Database Connection Tests**
```bash
# Test database connectivity
curl http://localhost:8081/health

# Send test webhook to verify no prepared statement errors
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/webhook/tradingview \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"ticker":"XAUUSD","action":"buy","entry":2650.00,"stop_loss":2640.00,"tp1":2660.00,"tp2":2670.00,"volume":0.01}'
```

### ‚úÖ **Position Management Tests**
```bash
# Verify MT5 bridge position modification endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/position/modify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"position_ticket":123456,"symbol":"XAUUSD","take_profit":2660.00,"partial_volume":0.01,"tp_type":"tp1"}'

# Check position count endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/positions/count
```

### ‚úÖ **End-to-End Workflow**
1. Send a buy signal with TP1 and TP2 levels
2. Verify entry trade execution in MT5
3. Confirm TP1 and TP2 orders are created as position-closing orders
4. Monitor position synchronization in database
5. Test partial TP execution when price hits TP1 level

## Configuration Updates Required

### Environment Variables
Add to your `.env` file:
```bash
# Database stability settings
DB_MAX_CONNECTIONS=3
DB_CONN_MAX_LIFETIME=15

# Ensure proper URL format
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host/db?sslmode=require&default_query_exec_mode=simple_protocol
```

## Monitoring Points

### üìä **Database Health**
- Monitor connection pool usage
- Watch for prepared statement errors in logs
- Check connection cycling frequency

### üìä **Position Tracking**
- Verify parent-child trade relationships
- Monitor TP order execution success rates
- Check position synchronization accuracy

### üìä **MT5 Integration**
- Monitor position modification success rates
- Track partial TP order creation
- Verify position ticket consistency

## Rolling Back (If Needed)

If issues arise, you can revert specific components:

1. **Database Config**: Remove the new connection parameters
2. **TP Orders**: Disable TP order creation in signal processing
3. **MT5 Bridge**: Use the original trade execution without position modification

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Changes**: Restart both trading engine and MT5 bridge
2. **Monitor Logs**: Watch for the specific error patterns that were fixed
3. **Test Gradually**: Start with small position sizes to verify fixes
4. **Scale Up**: Once confirmed stable, resume normal trading operations

**‚úÖ Both critical issues should now be resolved with proper position-based TP order management and stable database connections.**
